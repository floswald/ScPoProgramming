## Intro

::::: {.callout-note}
# Question

* What is a command shell and why would I use one?
:::::

::::: {.callout-tip}
# Objectives
- Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.
- Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.
::::::

## Do You GUI?

::: {.callout-tip}

# What's a GUI
A *Graphical User Interface* (GUI) lets the user interact by clicking with a mouse and using menus.
:::

. . .

* I love üòç a good Graphical User Interface (GUI)

. . .

* But. Bad things can happen.

# No More than 65,536 Rows

* Public Health England [missed 14.000 covid cases](https://www.influentialsoftware.com/how-an-nhs-test-and-trace-excel-error-lost-16000-covid-19-cases/)
* They used `.xls` document to collect data.

# No Growth with High Debt?

* [Reinhardt and Rogoff controversy](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646).^[Both are eminent researchers and we do *not* imply misconduct.]
* Inadvertently did not select all relevant countries on spreadsheet.

## Or Do you CLI?

::: {.callout-tip}

# What's a CLI
A *Command Line Interface* (CLI) allows interaction via (text) commands.
:::


* CLIs can collect commands somewhere - *reproducible*
* But one has to learn a *language*.
* They are great for *long, repetitive tasks*.
* It's often the **only** way to interact with high-performance computing. --> Show!

## The Shell {.smaller}

* The *shell* is a program where we can type in commands and get output.
* We often use very simple programs - good for just one thing.
* There is tremendous power in *combining* those little programs.
* It's a *platform* approach to an Operating System. 

::: {.callout-tip}
# Unix is a Platform

A protocol and many small program who interact according to the rules with each other

## Go! üöÄ

1. Open your terminal! (`GitBash` on Windows)
2. You should see something like
```bash
$
```
which is called the **prompt**. 

3. You **don't have to type** the `$`!
3. next to it, you see a cursor.


---

## First command: `ls`

* type `ls` and hit enter
* you see something like this as output:

```
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

* By default, the terminal opens in your home directory.
* `ls` *lists* the content of that directory.

---

## First Error!

::: {.callout-caution}
* If you mistype a command, or look for a program that is not installed, you get an error. Like:

```
bash-3.2$ ks
```

```
bash: ks: command not found
```
:::

* Look for a spelling mistake (it's `ls` not `ks`)
* Or install the required program.


## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem {.smaller}

* Nelle Nemo is a marine biologist. üåä üê°
* Just sampled gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).
* From 1520 samples she obtained measures of the relative abundance of 300 proteins.
* Her supervisor, *Professor Jones*, handed down to hear a program called `goostats.sh`.
* `goostats.sh` needs to be run on each of the 1520 samples.
* Paper needs to be ready by the end of the month.

---

## Battle Plan

* Using a GUI to run `goostats.sh`, Nelle will have to use her mouse to select and open a file 1520 times.
* If `goostats.sh` takes 30 secs to run, this will take more than 12 hours of Nelle's *active time*.
* With the help of the shell, Nelle could make her computer go through that list of files instead.
* **Bonus** : she will have a working pipeline, that can be re-run each time need be.

---

## What Does Nelle Need  {.smaller}

Nelle has needs to learn the following things:

- navigate to a file/directory
- create a file/directory
- check the length of a file
- chain commands together
- retrieve a set of files
- iterate over files
- run a shell script containing her pipeline

And we will be right next to her. üôÇ

# Key Points

- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
-  This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.
-  Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.
- The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.
