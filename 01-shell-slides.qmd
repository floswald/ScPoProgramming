## Intro

::::: {.callout-note}
# Question

* What is a command shell and why would I use one?
:::::

::::: {.callout-tip}
# Objectives
- Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users' programs.
- Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces.

## Do You GUI?

::: {.callout-tip}

# What's a GUI
A *Graphical User Interface* (GUI) lets the user interact by clicking with a mouse and using menus.
:::

. . .

* I love üòç a good Graphical User Interface (GUI)

. . .

* But.

# No More than 65,536 Rows

* Public Health England [missed 14.000 covid cases](https://www.influentialsoftware.com/how-an-nhs-test-and-trace-excel-error-lost-16000-covid-19-cases/)
* They used `.xls` document to collect data.

# No Growth with High Debt?

* [Reinhardt and Rogoff controversy](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646).^[Both are eminent researchers and we do *not* imply misconduct.]
* Inadvertently did not select all relevant countries on spreadsheet.

## Or Do you CLI?

::: {.callout-tip}

# What's a CLI
A *Command Line Interface* (CLI) allows interaction via (text) commands.
:::


* CLIs can collect commands somewhere - *reproducible*
* But one has to learn a *language*.
* They are great for *long, repetitive tasks*.
* It's often the **only** way to interact with high-performance computing.

## The Shell {.smaller}

* The *shell* is a program where we can type in commands and get output.
* We often use very simple programs - good for just one thing.
* There is tremendous power in *combining* those little programs.
* It's a *platform* approach to an Operating System. 

::: {.callout-tip}
# Unix is a Platform

A protocol and many small program who interact according to the rules with each other
