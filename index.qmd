# Welcome to *Introduction to Programming*

* This website is the home of the course _Introduction to Programming_ taught to first year PhD students (M1) in the doctoral program of the [department of economics](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) at Sciences Po Paris.
* This course assumes **no prior programming** experience.
* Below you will find setup instructions and a syllabus.
* You can obtain all material for this course from the associated github repository at [link](https://github.com/floswald/ScPoProgramming/)

## Objectives of this Course

* After this course, we want to be able to participate or conduct your own research project in an efficient way. *Research* nowadays means data sciencey stuff in most cases, certainly in Economics. 
* We want you to have a basic understanding of how an operating system (in particular, *your* OS) works.
* We want to be able to achieve a basic level of automation in repetitive tasks.
* We want you to know what Version Control is and how to use it in a research project.
* We will introduce some (hopefully) useful `R` programming.

# Setup Instructions

* You must bring your own laptop to each class.
* Please make sure you have an up to date operating system, i.e. run a software update before we start.
* Everybody should [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or make sure they have a recent version installed.
* Everybody should [install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or run an update on the installed program.


## Windows and Mac Specific Instructions

There are different instructions depending on whether you have a Mac or a Windows computer. Unix-based computers are similar to Macs in most respects.

### Windows

We need to install some things that make your windows computer a resemble a bit a Unix box. In particular, we want to be able to use the unix shell. Therefore, I want you to download and install 

1. [GitForWindows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. [Software Carpentry Windows Installer](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/tag/v0.3)


### Mac

You should be all set. To make sure we have really everything we need, open `Terminal.app` (in *Applications > Utilities* or do `Cmd + Space` to get spotlight search and type `terminal`). Then paste this code and hit enter:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

click on *install* (don't click on `get Xcode`)


### Unix

Same, all set. Maybe open a terminal and type

```bash
git --version
```

if that throws an error, install it with your package manager, e.g.

```bash
sudo apt install git-all
```
