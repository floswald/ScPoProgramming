Research nowadays means data sciencey stuff in most cases, certainly in Economics.\nWe want you to have a basic understanding of how an operating system (in particular, your OS) works.\nWe want to be able to achieve a basic level of automation in repetitive tasks.\nWe want you to know what Version Control is and how to use it in a research project.\nWe will introduce some (hopefully) useful R programming."

    "text": "Windows and Mac Specific Instructions\nThere are different instructions depending on whether you have a Mac or a Windows computer. Unix-based computers are similar to Macs in most respects.\n\nWindows\nWe need to install some things that make your windows computer a resemble a bit a Unix box. In particular, we want to be able to use the unix shell. Therefore, I want you to download and install\n\nGitForWindows\nSoftware Carpentry Windows Installer\n\n\n\nMac\nYou should be all set. To make sure we have really everything we need, open Terminal.app (in Applications > Utilities or do Cmd + Space to get spotlight search and type terminal). Then paste this code and hit enter:\nxcode-select --install\nclick on install (donâ€™t click on get Xcode)\n\n\nUnix\nSame, all set. Maybe open a terminal and type\ngit --version\nif that throws an error, install it with your package manager, e.g.\nsudo apt install git-all"
