## Combining Commands

* We are now ready to combine some of the commands we learned.

* You will see that here is where the real power lies.

* Let's navigate into our exercise data folder first.

```bash
$ cd ~/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins
$ ls
cubane.pdb   ethane.pdb   methane.pdb  octane.pdb   pentane.pdb  propane.pdb
```

* Those are *protein data bank* files.

---

## Capturing Output

* Introducing the `wc` word count command. 

```bash
wc cubane.pdb
20     156    1158 cubane.pdb
```
29 lines, 156 words, 1158 characters.

* Let's **redirect** the output of `wc` to a file instead with `>`:

```bash
wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
```

* no ouput on screen, you see? but now there is a new file: `lengths.txt`.
* Let's *concatenate* its content (i.e. join together) and print to screen:
```bash
$ cat lengths.txt 
      20 cubane.pdb
      12 ethane.pdb
       9 methane.pdb
      30 octane.pdb
      21 pentane.pdb
      15 propane.pdb
     107 total
```

---

## Reading Text Files

* `cat` prints the entire thing to screen.
* `tail` only the end
* `head` only the beginning
* `less` lets you scroll and read (arrows up/down or `j` (up) and `k` (down), `q` exits.)

```bash
$ head -n 3 ../animal-counts/animals.csv
$ tail -n 2 ../animal-counts/animals.csv
$ less ../../north-pacific-gyre/NENE01729A.txt
```


---

## Printing Text with `echo`

* The `echo` function prints text - by default to screen:
```bash
$ echo hi
hi
```

* But you can redirect it to a file as well:
```bash
$ echo I said hi! > echofile1.txt
```

::: {.callout-important}

# Challenge

Do 2 times in a row:
```bash
$ echo I said hi! > echofile1.txt
```

Now do twice (notice `>>`!)
```bash
$ echo I said hi! >> echofile2.txt
```
* What's happening?

## Appending to Files

::: {.callout-important}

# Challenge

Consider the file `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv`. What is result of this:

```bash
$ head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv
$ tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv
```

1. The first three lines of animals.csv?
2. The last two lines of animals.csv?
3. The first three lines and the last two lines of animals.csv?
4. The second and third lines of animals.csv?

## Filtering Files with `sort`

* `sort` reads a file and *sorts* it's content to screen
* it does not change the file.

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt 
```

```
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
```

---

## Filtering Files and using the result

* Cool ðŸ˜Ž but now we want to use this list.
* Could save it to a new file?

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted_lengths.txt
$ head -n 2 sorted_lengths.txt
```

```
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
```

## Filtering Files and **the pipe**

* We call `|` the pipe. It takes output from a command and gives it to another command.
* Modern languages use their own version of this (R has a package and now also a native pipe, julia has of course a pipe etc. Stata not sure ðŸ˜œ)
* The **pipe** allows us to do this *without* storing intermediate results.

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
```

```
 9 methane.pdb
```    

* But, wait ðŸ¤”. Then we don't even need `lengths.txt`:

```bash
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
```

```
 9 methane.pdb
```    

* That's a *pipeline*. ðŸ¤¯

## Piping Away

* Make sure we are still in `~/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins`


:::{.callout-important}

# Pipe Dreams

Which of the following commands shows us the 3 files with the least number of lines in the current directory? Build the pipeline up from left to right to check!

1. `wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3`
2. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3`
3. `wc -l * | sort -n | tail -n 4 | head -n 3`
4. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3`

Option 4 is correct. Option 3 finds the ones with *most* lines.

## Cutting and Piping

* We have a `.csv` file here: `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts`
* Let's use the `cut` command to get parts of it.

```bash
$ cd ~/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts
$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.csv
```

::: {.callout-important}

# Building a Pipe

* `uniq` filters **adjacent** matching lines in a file.
* Can you extend the above command with `uniq` (and another command?) such that we get the list of unique animal names?
* Add the `-c` flag to `uniq` to get a contingency table.

## House Prices in France

The below dataset contains information on house sales (price, location, type of house etc). We call one record a _housing transaction_.

Using the shell:

1. Use `wget` to download data to [from here](https://static.data.gouv.fr/resources/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres/20240408-125738/valeursfoncieres-2023.txt) to your downloads folder as `carburants.csv`: `wget https://static.data.gouv.fr/resources/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres/20240408-125738/valeursfoncieres-2023.txt`
2. use `wc -l` to count how many rows (*lines*) there are
3. use `head -n 2` to see the first two rows (the *header*)
4. Use the above solution to build a contingency table that tells us the number of housing transactions per *commune*. Show the 10 cities with most housing transactions.
5. Compute the average of variable `Valeur fonciere`. You should use the `awk` command like this : `awk 'BEGIN{s=0;}{s+=$1;}END{print s/(NR);} your_file.txt'`

1. `wget https://static.data.gouv.fr/resources/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres/20240408-125738/valeursfoncieres-2023.txt`
2. `wc -l valeursfoncieres-2023.txt`
3. `head -n 2 valeursfoncieres-2023.txt`
4. `cut -d '|' -f 18 valeursfoncieres-2023.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head -n 10 `
5. `cut -d '|' -f 11 valeursfoncieres-2023.txt | cut -d , -f 1 | awk 'BEGIN{s=0;}{s+=$1;}END{print s/(NR);}' `
6. If you have R installed you can check whether this is the same as reading this column into it (it's not! odd.)

```bash
Rscript -e 'x = data.table::fread(cmd = "cut -d \'|\' -f 11 valeursfoncieres-2023.txt | cut -d , -f 1"); x[, mean(`Valeur fonciere`,na.rm = TRUE)]'
